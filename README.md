## 🛠 Technologies Used

- *HTML* – Structure and display screen
- *CSS* – Glassmorphism styling, layout (Grid), and light/dark themes
- *JavaScript* – Handling input, calculations, and button events

---

## 🔧 How It Works

- The calculator interface uses a grid layout to position all the buttons cleanly.
- Event listeners detect button clicks and update the input display.
- The eval() function is used to evaluate expressions (in a safe try-catch block).
- Light/Dark mode is toggled by adding/removing a dark class from the body.
